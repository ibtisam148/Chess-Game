# Chess-Game
First of All, we integrate JIRA with our Github repository.
Then we added sprints in JIRA.
Link of the JIRA workflow is [https://tse-blank.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CG/boards/1/roadmap].
In this workflow we performed the first three steps.
In the 4th step, we integrate our repository with Codiga for code reviews.
The Link of  the Codiga reviews is provided here [https://app.codiga.io/project/36124/dashboard]
